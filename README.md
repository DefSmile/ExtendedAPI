# ExAPI
Unofficial open source Epicbot extended API
This API is in no way owned or managed by the official Epicbot team and is separate from the main Epicbot API

# Guidelines
* Follow Java naming and code conventions
* Packages must start with `com.extended.api`
* Names for classes should be clear and not collide with the orginal Epicbot API naming scheme.
* Try to keep methods as short as possible.
